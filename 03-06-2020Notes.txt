TypeScript Architecture

	Settingup Environment for TypeScript
	================================
1. Install Node JS on your PC

    - We are installing Node Js for a Package Manager called
	"NPM"
    - Package Manager is an software solution for installing library on your PC. 
    - Various Package Managers are used by developers like
	- NPM, Bower, Ruby Gems, NuGet etc..

     a) Visit 
	https://nodejs.org/en/download/
      b) Download ".msi" for your windows PC
      c) Install from ".msi"
    	
Note: Install  Node JS 10+   
    
      e) Verify Installed Node JS and NPM
	- Open Command Prompt
	     C:\> node -v
	     C:\> npm -v 

2. Install TypeScript  [Latest version  is 3.9]

    - Open Command Prompt
    - Type the command

	>npm install -g  typescript@latest

	g [Global]
    - Check the installed version by using the command

	> tsc -v

		
Working with TypeScript in a WebSite:
================================
1. Make sure that your computer have a Web Server
	Tomcat, IIS, [Internet Information Services]
    - Every windows PC have a web server called IIS
    - Goto Control Panel
    - Open Administrative Tool
    - Look for "Internet Information Services Manager"
 
    Note: It IIS is missing in your Control Panel then Add from "Programs and Features"
	- Goto Programs and Features
	- Click on "Turn Windows Features ON or OFF
	- Select "Internet Information Services"
	- OK
2. Test your WebServer
	- Open Browser
	- Type the following URL
	 
	  http://localhost   (or)   http://127.0.0.1

3. Create a new Website on Local Server
    [Technically Web is a Virtual Directory on WebServer]
    - Open Local IIS
	Run → inetmgr
	[Control Panel → Administrative Tools → IIS]
    - Expand Local Computer [http://localhost]
    - Expand "Sites" folder
    - Right Click on "Default Website"
    - Select the option
	"Add Virtual Directory" [Website]
 
	Alias : [SiteName]  :  TypeScriptOnlineProject
	Physical Path         :  C:\TypeScriptOnlineProject

    - OK

  Site Virtual Path:  
        http://localhost/TypeScriptOnlineProject
  Physical Path:
        C:\TypeScriptOnlineProject

4. Create an Index Page for Website
     - Open NotePad and Create new HTML document

       <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head> <title> TypeScript | Home </title> </head>
<body>
   <h2> TypeScript Online Project </h2>
</body>
</html>

     - Save into website Physical Path by name
	"index.html"

5. Lets Create a TypeScript file for Project
    - Create a new folder in Website Physical Path
	"code"
    - Open Notepad and type the "TypeScript code"

	var msg = "Welcome to TypeScript";
	document.write(msg);
    - Save  into "Code" folder by name
	 "Welcome.ts"
    - Transcompile TypeScript file into JavaScript
 
            C:\TypeScriptOnlineProject\Code> tsc welcome.ts

     - This Generates "welcome.js"

     - Use Welcome.js in your HTML Page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head> <title> TypeScript | Home </title>
  <script src="code/welcome.js"> </script>
 </head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
