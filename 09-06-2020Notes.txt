  1. number type
      Syntax: 
	 let variableName:Datatype = value;
	 let float:number = 4.6;

  2. string type
  

	         String Type in TypeScript
- String is literal with group characters [alpha numeric and special chars] enclosed in 
	a) Double Quotes
		"string"
	b) Single Quotes
		'string'
	c) Back Ticks 
		`string`
- Double and Single quotes are used to swap between outer and inner string vice versa.
 
     let msg:string ="<a href='home.html'>Home</a>";
     let msg:string ='<a href="home.html">Home</a>';

- Back Tick is available from ES5 
- Back Tick allows an Embeded Expression inside string.
- Single and Double quotes will not allow embeded expression they use concatination.
- String with embeded expression is defined by using
	"${ }"  - it is possible only for backtick

Ex:
let username:string = "John"
let age:number = 20;
console.log("Hello !"+ " " + username+" "+"You will be"+ " " + (age+1) + " " +"Next Year");
console.log(`Hello ! ${username} You will be ${age+1} Next Year`);

- In a string literal you can define special chars. But few special characters are not printable. The non printable character usually escape printing.

- You can print any non-printable character by using "\".

      let path:string = "D:\Pics\flower.jpg";
      console.log(path);
     
       O/P:   D:Picsflower.jpg

      let path:string = "D:\\Pics\\flower.jpg";

       O/P:   D:\Pics\flower.jpg

Ex:
let path:string = "\"D:\\Images\\Cars\\Ferrari.jpg\"";
console.log(`Path=${path}`);
