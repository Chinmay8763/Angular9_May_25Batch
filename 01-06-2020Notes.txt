Problems in JavaScript:
- JavaScript is not a strongly typed language.
	var x = 10;   // x is initialized with 10 - number
	x = "John"; // valid
- JavaScript allows contradictionary values.
- Explicitly developer have to handle types and their restrictions.
- JavaScript supports OOP but not completely OOP language.
- Contracts, Templates, Code Security, Dynamic Polymorphism are not completely supported.

	class JavaScriptClass {
	  private name = "John"; // private is not supported
	 }
- JavaScript is not strictly typed by default. You have to turn on strict mode explicitly.

	Strictly Typed = Follow Coding Rules

- JavaScript handles schema less data, which will a problem when you are dealing with Schema based.

- Google Angular Team Decided to develop a new Language in order overcome the issues with JavaScript and they started a script called "AtScript" in 2013

- Microsoft already developed a similar script for their ".NET" languages called "TypeScript". 

- TypeScript designed by "Anders Hejlberg" who developed a language called "C#" for Microsoft.

- TypeScript is an Open Source and Cross platform language development by Microsoft and it is being used by Angular and other technologies related to web.

- TypeScript is strictly superset of JavaScript.
- TypeScript is in strict mode by default.
- TypeScript is Strongly Typed. [Duck Typing]
- TypeScript is an OOP. It supports all features of OOP.
- TypeScript transcompiles everything into JavaScript.
- TypeScript speeds up your development experience by catching errors and providing fixes before you even run your code.
- TypeScript runs on any browser, any OS,  and any where JavaScript runs.
- TypeScript supports low level features. So that it can directly interact with hardware services.
- It can operate on very lowmemory devices.
- TypeScript is completely built by using TypeScript.
- TypeScript can use all JavaScript library.
