1. What are the basic requirements for building an End to End Web Application?
	- HTML
	- CSS
	- Client Side Script
	      JavaScript, TypeScript
	- Server Side Script
	      JSP, PHP, Node JS, ASP
	- Database
	      Oracle, MySql, MongoDb
	- Middleware
	      Express , JsX

"Tim Berners Lee" introduced - Web - HTML - 1990

What are the Challenges in modern Web Development?
==============================================
	         > 90 % of web users
	            are using web from smart devices
	             [mobile, tabs]
1. Unified UX
     - Unified User Experience
     - An application should have same feel, appearence and functionality across any device.
     - Application should not optimize.
     - Mobile users must get access to everything.

2. Fluid UX
     - User will stay on only one page and can get access to everything on to the page.
     - New details are added to page without reloading the complete page.

3. Loosely coupled and extensible
    - Without disturbing the existing application we must able to push in new components.

4. Simiplified Deployment and upgrades


What is the solution?
==================
- Better build SPA or Progressive web application instead of tradional web applications.

How to build SPA and Progressive Application? Can we continue with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery?

		   (or)
Can we build SPA and Progressive web Applications using JavaScript and JQuery?

	                  "Yes"

Why we are looking into New Technologies for building SPA and Progressive Web Application? What are the issues with JavaScript and JQuery?


1. Lot of DOM manipulations.
    [DOM - Document Object Model]
2. Lot of references
3. Lot of coding
4. Heavy pages
5. Slow Rendering
6. Navigation issues
7. Data Binding issues [depend on lot of events]
8. JavaScript is a Language and JQuery is an Library
    [Language and Library can build Application but can't 
	control application flow ]

	 "Better use a Framework"
- A framework is an software architectural pattern that can build the application and also control the application flow.

Do we have any Framework to use client side?
	       "Yes"
  - Knockout JS
  - Ember Js
  - Vue
  - Backbone Js
  - Angular Js
	Client Side "MVC, MVP, MVVM"

  Angular JS is an open source and cross platform framework introduced by Google and mantained by a large community of organizations and developers to address the issues in SPA.
	      Google - Angular JS - Framework
	           2010 - Google - Angular JS

What are the issues with Angular Js?
1. Angular Js is not designed for what we are using.
2. Hence lot of GAP's.
3. Angular Js is JavaScript based
4. JavaScript is not strongly typed it is schema less.
	var x = 10;
	x = "A";    // valid
          data = [
	       {Name:"TV", Price: 45000.44},
	       {Names:"Mobile", Price: "Shoe"}
	    ];   // valid

	data [0].Name
                 data [1].Names
5. Angular Js uses a legacy library
6. Slow in rendering output and slow in startup

		2012- Angular JS Team
- They dont want to distrub angular js as it is already being used by many applications.
- Better to build to a new Environment
- Better to build a platform for developer
    [It provides end to end tools for developer]
     includes languages, frameworks, debugging, testing
- From building to deploying everything is provided
- Google initiated an Developers platform called
		"Angular"
- They decided to develop a new language for angular instead of JavaScript. 
- They started a language called "atScript"
- Microsoft developed a language called "TypeScript" for its language C# with web technologies.
	"Anders Hejlberg"
- TypeScript is alternative for developers instead of using JavaScript
- Angular - Google - TypeScript - Microsoft

	     2014 - Google - Angular 2 - TypeScript
                      2019 - Angular 9 Stable
	     2020 - Angular 10 pre release

Angular JS   - 1.7.9  Latest
Angular        - 9

Only Angular 7, 8, 9  LTS [Long Term Support]
