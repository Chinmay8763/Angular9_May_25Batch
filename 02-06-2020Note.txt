What are the Features of TypeScript?
	
	           TypeScript Architecture
	[TypeScript built by using TypeScript]

 Compiler : It used as translator
 1. Core TypeScript Compiler
	- Developer write code in TypeScript
	- Core TypeScript compiler verifies the keywords,
	  Syntax, Blocks, DataTypes, memory allocation.
	- It reports the errors.
	- If it is compiled successfully then it is ready for
	  transcompiling.
	- The key components in TypeScript core compiler
	  are:
		core.ts
		program.ts
		scanner.ts
		emitter.ts
		parser.ts
		checker.ts

 2. Standalone Compiler
	- It is a compiler used to transcompile the type
	  script code into JavaScript.
	- "TSC" is a transcompiler for TypeScript, which
	    generates a JavaScript file.

	demo.ts → tsc.ts [compiler] → demo.js

Service: It is a pre-defined business logic with re-usable functions. 

3. TypeScript Language Service:  It provides all the repository [library] for typescript language. Keywords, functions, syntax all are verified from language service.
	       "services.ts"

  ex:
	array.length = "A";  // invalid
	          [number] = can't assign string


4. tsserver [server.ts]:  It is responsible for hosting , compiling, processing and generating output for typescript programs. It is the location where typescript programs are compiled and processed.

5. VS Shim:  It is responsible for translating your typescript code into platform independent code. [byte code]

6. VS Managed Language Service: It contains the library, which is cross platform.

7. Editors: Contains the rules for an IDE [Integrated Development Environments] in order to handle typescript. The IDE can be
	Visual Studio Code
	Sublime
	Web Strom
	DW, Eclipse etc..
